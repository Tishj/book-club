# Add Your Code
1. Make a directory with the same name as your intra username in the appropriate directory for the book.
2. Do or add whatever you want in there. Don't forget to gitignore any unnecessary or generated files like build directories, binaries, etc.

# Concept
Implementations from different people for the books we're reading at the Codam Book Club.
If you want a code review, you could make a pull request and request someone to look at it.
